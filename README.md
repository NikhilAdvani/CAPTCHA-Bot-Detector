# CAPTCHA Bot Detection System

This project simulates pointer movement data to distinguish human users from bots using behavioral biometrics and machine learning. The model is trained on synthetic sessions of cursor movements that mimic different types of human users (e.g., power users, elderly users) and bots (e.g., linear bots, ML-mimicking bots).

---

## üîç What It Does

- **Generates** 100 realistic pointer movement sessions (50 human, 50 bot)
- **Extracts** behavioral features (velocity stats, path efficiency, entropy)
- **Trains** models (Random Forest and XGBoost) using GridSearchCV
- **Evaluates** performance using ROC-AUC, average precision, CV scores
- **Visualizes** metrics: ROC, PR, confusion matrix, feature importance
- **Predicts** new session labels with confidence scores

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Human user types: casual user, power user, elderly user, CAD designer
- Bot types: simple scripted bots, ML-inspired mimics
- Feature set includes:
  - Velocity (mean, std, max)
  - Time intervals (mean, std)
  - Path efficiency (start-to-end vs. traveled distance)
  - Directional entropy
  - Acceleration variance
  - One-hot encoded time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night)
